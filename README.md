# Fraud Transaction Detection
# Overview
Fraud Transaction Detection is a machine learning project aimed at enhancing financial security by implementing a sophisticated fraud detection system. Leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms such as XGBoost and Isolation Forest, this project is designed to identify and prevent fraudulent activities within large-scale financial datasets.

# Key Features
# Machine Learning Model: 
The core of the system employs XGBoost and Isolation Forest algorithms, fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance in identifying fraudulent transactions.

# Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering: 
Rigorous data cleaning processes ensure the reliability of the dataset, while feature engineering enhances the model's ability to discern subtle patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior.

# Hyperparameter Tuning:
The model undergoes careful hyperparameter tuning to maximize its accuracy and robustness in handling diverse patterns within financial transactions.

# Insightful Analysis: 
The project provides comprehensive insights into the key factors influencing fraud detection. This includes the examination of transaction amounts, account balances, and transaction types to better understand the nuanced characteristics of fraudulent behavior.
